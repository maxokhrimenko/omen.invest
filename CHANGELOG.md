## [4.0.0] - 2025-09-19

### 🚀 Major Architecture Refactoring

This is a **complete rewrite** of the application following Clean Architecture principles and SOLID design patterns.

### ✨ Added
- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Complete separation of concerns across domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **Interactive CLI Interface**: User-friendly menu system for all operations
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business entities (Ticker, Position, Portfolio) and value objects (Money, Percentage, DateRange)
- **Use Case Pattern**: Dedicated use cases for LoadPortfolio, AnalyzePortfolio, AnalyzeTicker, and CompareTickers
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract interfaces with concrete implementations for CSV and YFinance data sources
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container setup in main application
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 38 tests covering unit and integration scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based settings with Settings service
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling across all layers
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase

### 🔄 Changed
- **Application Entry Point**: New `main.py` with interactive CLI (replaces direct script execution)
- **Data Flow**: Request/Response pattern for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven approach with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation**: Complete rewrite with architecture documentation

```

### 📊 Performance Improvements
- **Faster Execution**: Optimized data processing and analysis
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better resource management
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports easy extension for new features

### 🧪 Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 34 tests for core business logic
- **Integration Tests**: 4 tests for end-to-end workflows
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage for domain layer
- **CI Ready**: Full test automation support

### 📚 Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite with new usage instructions
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed technical architecture documentation
- **Implementation Plan**: Comprehensive development tracking

### 🔄 Backwards Compatibility
- **Legacy Scripts Preserved**: Original scripts remain functional
- **Same CSV Format**: No changes to input data format
- **Same Metrics**: All original calculations preserved and enhanced

### 🚀 Migration Guide
To use the new application:
1. Run `python main.py` instead of individual scripts
2. Follow the interactive menu for all operations
3. Legacy scripts still available: `python portfolio_analysis_consolidated.py`
